Data Exploration

Starting with some basic queries to get familair with the dataset and its main features.

1) I will check the size of the dataset. Since the dataset I found on Kaggle states that each row is a unique customer, the total number of rows should also be
equal to the number of unique customers. I will double-check it myself just in case.  

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `sql_portfolio.bank_csv`

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(CLIENTNUM))
FROM `sql_portfolio.bank_csv`

In both cases, I get 10,127 as a result, which means that effectively the dataset contains the information of unique customers.
